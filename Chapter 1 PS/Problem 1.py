print(''' And I hope you cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, take it easy on me, baby
'Cause I tried with you, saw my life with you
End of time with you, now we're strangers
And I hope that you still cry for me like I cry for you
Every night for you, I've been living with this lie
Now I can't hide the truth, I can't hide the truth
Girl, I'll cry for you
Girl, I'll cry for you, ooh, yeah ''')
